Given different circumstances, those on the inside and those on the outside might be reversed. We believe everyone has something essential to contribute. We believe inclusion makes for a more peaceful world. We believe we CAN foster sustainable and measured change. We think todays needy can be the helpers of tomorrow. Change is difficult, often because we are scared, ignorant, ill-equipped, and alone. KeelWorks addresses these factors for greater success. Our special sauce is : address the barriers, arm with basic competencies, provide the savvy of lessons learned, and provide a community of mutual support and accountability for as long as it takes.
